Silhouettes of hundreds of African mammals.
From aardvark to zorilla, these PNG silhouettes represent the ~223 largest African mammals.

These PNGs were originally created for the ENDANGERED SAFARI project, which you may enjoy here: http://www.infowetrust.com/endangeredsafari/
The silhouettes were based mostly on illustrations obtained from MAMMALâ€™S PLANET, a database of animal illustrations: http://www.planet-mammiferes.org/ 
A list of artists of the original art can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/159MgygKy40ZfM3n-0zrEGUASGOXwnIQ2Vmba89PpIBM/edit?usp=sharing
